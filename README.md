# 2smpb02e-grove-arduino
This library is for evaluating Omron sensor 2SMPB-02E with Arduino UNO.  

2SMPB-02E is a compact MEMS absolute pressure sensor with high accuracy and low current consumption.  
Built-in 24-bit ADC with low noise, it can measure atmospheric pressure with high accuracy.  
Control and output are digital methods via the I2C/SPI interface, which realizes low current consumption by automatic sleep mode.
